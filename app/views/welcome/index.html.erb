			<h3>What is the DA</h3>
			<p>The DA is a exculsive club of really cool people who among other things love Harry Potter.</p>
			<p>We also enjoy other books and movies such as Inception, The Hunger Games, Lost and Zelda.</p>
			<h3>Sounds like my kinda group how do I join!</h3>
			<p>First off you have to be nominated by and existing member of the DA.
			After nomination you <strong>must</strong> take a test on you knowledge if the Harry Potter World.<br />
